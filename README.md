## Project Overview

The AMFU is a self-contained system that automates the most challenging aspects of mushroom cultivation during the fruiting stage. It features a web-based interface for remote monitoring and control, making mushroom growing more accessible and reliable for both hobbyists and small-scale growers.

Think of it as a smart incubator that maintains perfect growing conditions 24/7, so you can focus on enjoying the harvest rather than constantly adjusting parameters!
